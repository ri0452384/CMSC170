K-Means Machine Problem Solution Readme:

In order to evaluate part 1 of this solution, build and run the kmdata_reader.py. 
It will generate 3 files for each iteration: 
	-iter<iteration_number>_ca.txt - displays the cluster_id for each point in the dataset
	-iter<iteration_number>_cm.txt - shows the centroid locations, J, and difference to previous J.
	-Iteration<iteration_number>.png - the graph of all points in the dataset, and centroids

For the next part, simply build and run kmimg_reader.py. It will generate the kmimg-new.png, and also show the two images side by side on screen.
